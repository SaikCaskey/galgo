A fork of https://github.com/inaka/galgo to add some stuff that I want - it's pretty cool

Feel free to contribute to the original repo, I was adding a debug function to a production app, this is only allowed in the Debug version so that I can view logs without adding/managing a floating view. 

My guess is that it wasn't intended as a production piece.

## Gradle

```compile 'com.github.saikcaskey:systemecks-galgo:1.0.1'```
